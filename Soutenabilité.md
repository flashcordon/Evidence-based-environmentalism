- The inertia of carbon emissions due to such mutually reinforcingphysical, economic, and social constraints is referred to as carbon lock-in.Carbon lock-in is a special case of path dependency, which is common in theevolution of complex systems. However, carbon lock-in is particularly proneto entrenchment given the large capital costs, long infrastructure lifetimes,and interrelationships between the socioeconomic and technical systems in-volved
- We identify three main types of carbonlock-in and describe how they coevolve: (a) infrastructural and technological,(b) institutional, and (c) behavioral. Although each type of lock-in has its ownset of processes, all three are tightly intertwined and contribute to the inertiaof carbon emissions
- Ambitious goals for climate change mitigation such as those adopted in the Paris Agreementwill require rapid reduction of regional and global CO2emissions, on the order of 5–10% peryear (1, 2), which in turn requires transformations of vast and entrenched networked systemsof infrastructure, institutions, and human behaviors. The current global energy system is thelargest network of infrastructure ever built, reflecting tens of trillions of dollars of assets and twocenturies of technological evolution, and is supported by an equally extensive complex of coevolvedinstitutions, policies, and consumer preferences (3–5). Roughly 80% of the energy delivered bythis system worldwide now comes from burning fossil fuels (6), with attendant CO2emissions thatare the primary cause of climate change (7).However, the inertia of technologies, institutions, and behaviors individually and interactivelylimit the rate of such systemic transformations by a path-dependent process known as carbonlock-in, whereby initial conditions, increasing economic returns to scale, and social and individualdynamics act to inhibit innovation and competitiveness of low-carbon alternatives
- Path-dependent processes are those that develop inertial resistance to large-scale systematicshifts, with resistance to change driven by favorable initial social and economic conditions and the momentum of increasing returns to scale. There are many examples of path dependence thatentrench technical, institutional, and behavioral systems with known technical and environmen-tal disadvantages. Where these disadvantages include carbon emissions to the atmosphere, thepath dependence is termed carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in generally constrains technological,economic, political, and social efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
- We conceptualize three major types of carbon lock-in: (a) lock-in associated with thetechnologies and infrastructure that indirectly or directly emit CO2and shape the energy supply;(b) lock-in associated with governance, institutions, and decision-making that affect energy-relatedproduction and consumption, thereby shaping energy supply and demand; and (c) lock-in relatedto behaviors, habits, and norms associated with the demand for energy-related goods and services
-  We refer to the path dependence of these interacting techno-logical, institutional, and behavioral systems as lock-in, with carbon lock-in referring to a specificnegative type of lock-in related to systems that emit carbon. In contrast, lock-in favors the statusquo but is normatively neutral: It can foster either positive or negative outcomes. Carbon lock-in isnegative because it inhibits changes deemed desirable, such as a transition to a low-carbon society
-  INFRASTRUCTURAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL LOCK-INThe long life of physical infrastructure may lock societies into carbon-intensive emissions pathwaysthat are difficult or costly to change, emphasizing the importance of initial conditions and earlydecisions. They also involve long lead times, that is, investments in which costs occur now andpayoffs occur later, and create substantial sunk costs
-  There are two main strategies for reducing energy-related CO2emissions: decreasing the car-bon intensity of energy used (i.e., the CO2emitted per unit of energy) and decreasing the energyintensity of the economy (i.e., the energy used per unit of economic production). 
-  Energy demand patterns are locked in through large incremental investments in long-lastingbuilt infrastructure, such as street layouts, land use patterns, and buildings, with the ultimateeffect of inhibiting efforts to reduce the energy intensity of an economy. 
-  reductions in the carbon intensity of energy produced are constrained by long-lived fossil fuel–burning infrastructure, which are in turn dictated by operating conditions, fueltype/quality, and physical specifications, which typically change little over the lifetime of theinfrastructure (barring a major upgrade or retrofit). Despite known environmental disadvantages,the fossil fuel energy generation and distribution system thus represents a barrier to the adoptionof new and cleaner renewable energy technologies.
-  Less directly, fossil fuel–supporting infrastructures such as pipelines, refineries, and gasolinestations also contribute to locking in carbon intensity insofar as their value is dependent on theextraction and transport of fossil fuels. The lock-in contributed by these supporting infrastructuresmay be understood according to the concept of asset specificity (12), which describes inputs thatcannot be readily used by other systems because the investments are unique to a particular task.Thus, owners of assets that do not directly burn fossil fuels may nonetheless have strong incentivesto favor policies that maintain lock-in insofar as their assets are specific to the technologies favoredby the existing form of lock-in. Such supporting infrastructure also suggests the self-reinforcingincentives to resist change. Indeed, lock-in is not suboptimal from the point of view of those entitiesthat benefit from it. In this regard, lock-in is a commons dilemma: What benefits individuals maynot benefit the whole of society.
-  estimating global committed emissions, that is, futureCO2emissionsexpectedifallexistinginfrastructurewereoperatedduringitsexpectedlifetime(18).By assessing the age distribution of power plants, on-road vehicles, and industrial and commercialinfrastructure in different countries worldwide, it was found that these systems could be anticipatedto emit cumulative future emissions of 496 Gt of CO2, nearly half of which will come from powerplants (18).
-  However, these numbers are sensitive to the expected lifetime of power plants as well as theircapacityfactor(i.e.,thefractionoftimetheplantsareoperating).Forinstance,ithasbeenestimatedthat existing power plants worldwide would emit 307 Gt CO2in the future if a 40-year lifetime wereassumed for each plant (19). However, assuming a 20-year lifetime decreased the total emissionsto 98 Gt CO2, whereas assuming a lifetime of 60 years increased the estimate to 578 Gt CO2.
-  The sensitivity of committed emissions to infrastructure lifetime highlights a key uncertaintyrelated to quantifications of technological lock-in: The decision to retire a device is usually basedon an evaluation of economic competitiveness that incorporates mounting maintenance or loom-ing retrofit costs, the costs of alternatives, and the current and anticipated social and policy context(e.g.,Figure 1). Additionally, economic incentives can increase or reduce the extent of lock-in.
-  At its simplest, the problem is that adoption of a low-carbon energy technology is not economicallyfavorable until the capital and operating costs of the new technology are less (and probably sub-stantially less) (e.g., 20) than the capital and operating costs of the incumbent fossil fuel–burningtechnology (21), which is unlikely to happen during the normal lifetime of the already-operatingtechnology. This is especially true for power plants where the end-product is not functionallydifferent after switching to a new, cleaner technology. However, sufficiently aggressive policiescould shift the balance toward new low-carbon technologies
-  activists have begun tracking proposals to buildnew emitting infrastructure and opposing their construction on the grounds of the emissions thatthe new infrastructure would commit

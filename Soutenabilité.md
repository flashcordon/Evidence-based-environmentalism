- Dans le milieu du développement durable, une telle inertie 

- The inertia of carbon emissions due to such mutually reinforcingphysical, economic, and social constraints is referred to as carbon lock-in.Carbon lock-in is a special case of path dependency, which is common in theevolution of complex systems. However, carbon lock-in is particularly proneto entrenchment given the large capital costs, long infrastructure lifetimes,and interrelationships between the socioeconomic and technical systems in-volved
- We identify three main types of carbonlock-in and describe how they coevolve: (a) infrastructural and technological,(b) institutional, and (c) behavioral. Although each type of lock-in has its ownset of processes, all three are tightly intertwined and contribute to the inertiaof carbon emissions
- Ambitious goals for climate change mitigation such as those adopted in the Paris Agreementwill require rapid reduction of regional and global CO2emissions, on the order of 5–10% peryear (1, 2), which in turn requires transformations of vast and entrenched networked systemsof infrastructure, institutions, and human behaviors. The current global energy system is thelargest network of infrastructure ever built, reflecting tens of trillions of dollars of assets and twocenturies of technological evolution, and is supported by an equally extensive complex of coevolvedinstitutions, policies, and consumer preferences (3–5). Roughly 80% of the energy delivered bythis system worldwide now comes from burning fossil fuels (6), with attendant CO2emissions thatare the primary cause of climate change (7).However, the inertia of technologies, institutions, and behaviors individually and interactivelylimit the rate of such systemic transformations by a path-dependent process known as carbonlock-in, whereby initial conditions, increasing economic returns to scale, and social and individualdynamics act to inhibit innovation and competitiveness of low-carbon alternatives
- Path-dependent processes are those that develop inertial resistance to large-scale systematicshifts, with resistance to change driven by favorable initial social and economic conditions and the momentum of increasing returns to scale. There are many examples of path dependence thatentrench technical, institutional, and behavioral systems with known technical and environmen-tal disadvantages. Where these disadvantages include carbon emissions to the atmosphere, thepath dependence is termed carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in generally constrains technological,economic, political, and social efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
- We conceptualize three major types of carbon lock-in: (a) lock-in associated with thetechnologies and infrastructure that indirectly or directly emit CO2and shape the energy supply;(b) lock-in associated with governance, institutions, and decision-making that affect energy-relatedproduction and consumption, thereby shaping energy supply and demand; and (c) lock-in relatedto behaviors, habits, and norms associated with the demand for energy-related goods and services
-  We refer to the path dependence of these interacting techno-logical, institutional, and behavioral systems as lock-in, with carbon lock-in referring to a specificnegative type of lock-in related to systems that emit carbon. In contrast, lock-in favors the statusquo but is normatively neutral: It can foster either positive or negative outcomes. Carbon lock-in isnegative because it inhibits changes deemed desirable, such as a transition to a low-carbon society
-  INFRASTRUCTURAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL LOCK-INThe long life of physical infrastructure may lock societies into carbon-intensive emissions pathwaysthat are difficult or costly to change, emphasizing the importance of initial conditions and earlydecisions. They also involve long lead times, that is, investments in which costs occur now andpayoffs occur later, and create substantial sunk costs
-  There are two main strategies for reducing energy-related CO2emissions: decreasing the car-bon intensity of energy used (i.e., the CO2emitted per unit of energy) and decreasing the energyintensity of the economy (i.e., the energy used per unit of economic production). 
-  Energy demand patterns are locked in through large incremental investments in long-lastingbuilt infrastructure, such as street layouts, land use patterns, and buildings, with the ultimateeffect of inhibiting efforts to reduce the energy intensity of an economy. 
-  reductions in the carbon intensity of energy produced are constrained by long-lived fossil fuel–burning infrastructure, which are in turn dictated by operating conditions, fueltype/quality, and physical specifications, which typically change little over the lifetime of theinfrastructure (barring a major upgrade or retrofit). Despite known environmental disadvantages,the fossil fuel energy generation and distribution system thus represents a barrier to the adoptionof new and cleaner renewable energy technologies.
-  Less directly, fossil fuel–supporting infrastructures such as pipelines, refineries, and gasolinestations also contribute to locking in carbon intensity insofar as their value is dependent on theextraction and transport of fossil fuels. The lock-in contributed by these supporting infrastructuresmay be understood according to the concept of asset specificity (12), which describes inputs thatcannot be readily used by other systems because the investments are unique to a particular task.Thus, owners of assets that do not directly burn fossil fuels may nonetheless have strong incentivesto favor policies that maintain lock-in insofar as their assets are specific to the technologies favoredby the existing form of lock-in. Such supporting infrastructure also suggests the self-reinforcingincentives to resist change. Indeed, lock-in is not suboptimal from the point of view of those entitiesthat benefit from it. In this regard, lock-in is a commons dilemma: What benefits individuals maynot benefit the whole of society.
-  estimating global committed emissions, that is, futureCO2emissionsexpectedifallexistinginfrastructurewereoperatedduringitsexpectedlifetime(18).By assessing the age distribution of power plants, on-road vehicles, and industrial and commercialinfrastructure in different countries worldwide, it was found that these systems could be anticipatedto emit cumulative future emissions of 496 Gt of CO2, nearly half of which will come from powerplants (18).
-  However, these numbers are sensitive to the expected lifetime of power plants as well as theircapacityfactor(i.e.,thefractionoftimetheplantsareoperating).Forinstance,ithasbeenestimatedthat existing power plants worldwide would emit 307 Gt CO2in the future if a 40-year lifetime wereassumed for each plant (19). However, assuming a 20-year lifetime decreased the total emissionsto 98 Gt CO2, whereas assuming a lifetime of 60 years increased the estimate to 578 Gt CO2.
-  The sensitivity of committed emissions to infrastructure lifetime highlights a key uncertaintyrelated to quantifications of technological lock-in: The decision to retire a device is usually basedon an evaluation of economic competitiveness that incorporates mounting maintenance or loom-ing retrofit costs, the costs of alternatives, and the current and anticipated social and policy context(e.g.,Figure 1). Additionally, economic incentives can increase or reduce the extent of lock-in.
-  At its simplest, the problem is that adoption of a low-carbon energy technology is not economicallyfavorable until the capital and operating costs of the new technology are less (and probably sub-stantially less) (e.g., 20) than the capital and operating costs of the incumbent fossil fuel–burningtechnology (21), which is unlikely to happen during the normal lifetime of the already-operatingtechnology. This is especially true for power plants where the end-product is not functionallydifferent after switching to a new, cleaner technology. However, sufficiently aggressive policiescould shift the balance toward new low-carbon technologies
-  activists have begun tracking proposals to buildnew emitting infrastructure and opposing their construction on the grounds of the emissions thatthe new infrastructure would commit 
-  Carbon Emissions–Supporting Infrastructure : Most CO2-emitting technologies depend upon networks of supporting, nonemitting infrastruc-ture such as pipelines, refineries, and refueling stations, but the extent to which these latter tech-nologies contribute to carbon lock-in has not been quantitatively estimated. Doing so would entailvaluing the contribution of these technologies per unit of fuel burned (and CO2emitted), for ex-ample, by their cost of replacement.
-  Some of the longest-lived infrastructures are not CO2-emitting power plants—which last on theorder of decades—but buildings, transportation infrastructure, and other spatial arrangements of urban settlements. The fundamental building blocks that make up the physical features of urbansettlements, such as the layout of the street network and the size of the city blocks, can affectand lock in energy demand for long time periods (37, 38). Once in place, basic urban structuresand patterns are not easily reversed.
-  The long-lasting legacy of urban form is evident in citiesaround the world, with examples of spatial patterns dating back hundreds to thousands of years.
-  The expected lifetime of buildings varies considerably by geographic location, climate, culture,and affluence levels. Typical lifetimes for buildings and residences range from 20 to 30 years inplaces like China to more than 100 years in countries such as Australia and New Zealand (41, 42).Lifetimes are influenced by the durability and longevity of the materials used, the settlements,economic conditions, and cultural values
-  Retrofit cycles are strongly determined by affluence as well as culture for similar building stocktypes. For instance, in the United States, buildings are regularly remodeled—involving changes inmany parts of the building shell. In other regions, building shell–related infrastructure is mostlyreplaced only when needed. This can lead to highly variable cycles for major retrofits, from 20 yearsin the United States to 40 years in Europe.
-  INSTITUTIONAL LOCK-IN
-  The extent to which institutions generate carbon lock-in reflects political conflict between ac-tors who benefit from the existing set of economic, social, and cultural arrangements that favor a carbon-intensive trajectory and those who would benefit from an alternative trajectory. Both sidessee institutions as a way to establish stable economic, social, and cultural systems that favor theirinterests. The short time horizons and status quo biases of politicians make it difficult to overturngovernmental policies and institutions of any sort, including those that favor the use of fossil fuels
-  Institutions strengthen the interests of—and, hence, increase the resources available to—those powerful actors, such as oil and energy companies, that wield the most influence over theircreation and modification (28, 48, 50, 51). Not surprisingly, the networks that arise among policy-makers, institutional bureaucracies, and powerful energy interests further reinforce and stabilizecarbon-intensive systems. In an institutional feedback loop, those actors that most benefit fromexisting energy infrastructures push for institutional rules that further their interests, provide themwith greater resources, reinforce their political and economic dominance, and allow them to deployyet greater resources to shape institutions to their benefit. 
-  Whether exogenous shocks or intentional policy efforts foster an institutional transition de-pends on how relevant actors respond, which depends, in turn, on preexisting institutional, social,political, and economic landscapes
-  Like Hardin’s “tragedy of the commons” (64), the compelling logic of institutional lock-in suggestsa certain inevitability and pessimism with respect to avoiding institutional lock-in. Just as Ostrom’swork showed that people can overcome a tragedy of the commons, scholars have shown thatovercoming institutional lock-in is possible but requires propitious circumstances and exogenousshocks that galvanize stakeholder attention and create a window of opportunity
-  Breaking institutional lock-in to prompt a system-level transition to a decarbonizing trajectoryrequires efforts to plant, and foster the growth of, seeds of transition (49). At each level of gover-nance and in every sphere, those with interests threatened by a transition will mobilize to maintainexisting rules, institutions, and systems. But intentional efforts or propitious circumstances cancreate conditions of institutional plasticity, shifting the political and economic advantage towardactors who would benefit from such a transition.Transitions can begin with organic responses to incentives in the status quo economic and polit-ical system, for example, encouraging innovations by corporate interests that coincidentally reducecarbon emissions. But governments can adopt more proactive strategies that directly fund R&Dor that promote industry R&D. Early government funding of R&D in energy, transportation, andother sectors can demonstrate that certain technologies are possible and identify promising direc-tions for the R&D efforts of private industry.
-  “public policy has had a very significant influence on the development of new technologies in the area of renewableenergy” (66). Government policies on R&D and research infrastructure have been shown to fosterrenewable energy innovations, especially for technologies that are near a tipping point at whichsuch investments “could enable these attractive but generally marginal providers to become majorcontributors to regional and global energy supplies”
-  Over the past decade,there has been strong growth (∼8% per year) in government R&D in renewable energy amongboth developed and developing countries (70). Unlike corporations, governments may have longertime horizons, greater risk tolerance, greater resources, and greater concern with environmentalbenefits necessary to make the type of investments that could overcome the transition costs and setthe system on a more carbon-neutral trajectory. At present, however, global R&D in renewableenergy appears to be below levels needed to prompt such a transition 
-  Those seeking to promote a decarbonizing transition willbe well served by having prodecarbonization legislation and institutional rules ready for adoptionduring those usually brief and unpredictable moments when “windows of political opportunity”open up 
-   Break-out from carbon lock-in will require a meta-institutional transition occurring not only in ministries of energy and environment but also inthose of commerce, transportation, housing, agriculture, and national security. They need to occur in most, if not all, countries and at municipal and provincial levels. Transitions will needto take place in international institutions, including the United Nations, the World TradeOrganization, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the International EnergyAgency, the European Union, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-opment. The nature of lock-in means resistance is likely in all these venues, with the success ofany transition depending on a piling up of successes that become mutually reinforcing over timeand across venues
-   Generational turnover and secular trends toward postmaterial(i.e., more proenvironmental) values may induce gradual political, social, and economic shiftsthat will foster institutional plasticity and a transition to a decarbonizing trajectory (80–82). Yet,such a passive approach is likely to take longer than a more active strategy of escaping carbonlock-in
-   Positive environmental trends can be set in motion by institutions, but later gain amomentum of their own. International negotiations to protect the ozone layer prompted researchby chemical firms that identified chemical substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs) that proved cheaper than CFCs, with market forces then leading to CFC reductions thatoccurred faster than the Montreal Protocol required (83). Likewise, considerable research hasshown that many multinationals exhibit a variant of lock-in, requiring that overseas factories,subsidiaries, and contractors meet a single, environmentally stringent standard that serves to“export environmentalism” (
-   Policies can be designed to create incentives for decarbonizing trajectories to emerge, forexample, by designing them to be of indefinite duration, to ratchet up over time, and/or to re-quire unanimity for their revocation. Policies can be designed to nudge people and firms towarddecarbonization. Utilities, for example, could require consumers to opt out of—rather than into—purchasing renewable energy (85). Similarly, initially setting gas and carbon taxes in percentagesrather than currency units ensures taxes can maintain their effectiveness without requiring reautho-rization. 
-   policy humility is warranted: Our current state of carbonlock-in reflects past policy decisions, many of which were considered welfare-enhancing at thetime. To the extent that efforts succeed in promoting a carbon-reducing trajectory, they will surelylead to unwelcome future surprises as well. Policy makers should expect and plan for unforeseenexternalities, for example, by incorporating systems that require institutional review and promotesome degree of institutional plasticity and flexibility.
-   BEHAVIORAL LOCK-INClimate change is largely caused by unsustainable patterns in human behaviors, such as where welive, the size of homes we prefer, what we buy, and how we travel. 
-   mitigation research and policies historically have focused primarilyon technological solutions
-   Carbon lock-in has primarily been considered a technological characteristicof sociotechnical systems addressed without its social counterpart. Whereas government policiesand legal structures may change on timescales of decades, these social norms and cultural valuesare examples of slow-moving institutions that tend to evolve over centuries. There are, however,exceptions to this. Social norms regarding smoking; family size; and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, andtransgender communities have changed relatively quickly, for example. A lack of understanding ofhow behavioral patterns and routines emerge and if and how they can be altered has led to increasesin energy consumption, despite improvements in energy efficiency and heightened environmentalawareness
-   Most applied research on behaviorchange has grown out of the health sciences, and there is still a paucity of behavioral lock-inresearch that is specifically related to climate change
-   the literature reviewed in thissection primarily comes from three largely disconnected sources: (a) psychological and economicliterature on habits and behavioral momentum; (b) literature on behavioral transitions relatedto proenvironmental action, resource management, or lifestyle choices; and (c) sociologicalliterature on the formation of lifestyles, social norms, and routines. All literature reviewed focuseson the persistence of carbon-intensive behaviors
-   Lock-In of Individual BehaviorsThough rational choice theory is still the predominant behavioral model used in policy, modelsof psychological decision-making have evolved from conceptualizing individuals as fully rationalactors (91, 92) to incorporating the powerful role of context and repetition in cognitive processes(93). For decisions such as daily transportation choices, product preferences, and how and whento use household electricity, decision making starts as a conscious deliberation process and pro-gressively becomes more automatic with repetition, until an association between the situationand behavior is created 
-   Habits can exert significant influence over regular behaviors and have been extensively studiedin relation to commuting. Estimates show that a shift in travel behaviors could reduce trans-portation CO2emissions by 50% by the end of the century (99). However, these reductionsassume behavioral sensitivity and flexibility to changes in the utility-cost structure of transporta-tion choices. This is a problematic assumption considering that travel behaviors have been shownto be habitual 
-   There is little consensus on the potential and ethical use of policy interventions to change habits.In a review of 77 travel behavior change studies, less than 20% were judged to be methodologicallystrong, and only half of those were successful at reducing car use
-   More successful interventions comply with the habit-discontinuity hypothesis—which posits thatbehaviors are more pliable when a context change disrupts the routine (108). These interventionstake advantage of naturally occurring life transitions, such as a relocation, retirement, or a newjob, to establish new behavioral practices (103, 109). For example, in a study of 14,000 residentsin Brussels, those who had recently moved were more likely to apply for energy subsidies thanthose who had been in the same home for more than three years (110). A similar tactic is totemporarily dislodge habits by incentivizing alternative options. For example, in a study wheredrivers were given a free one-month bus pass, attitudes toward bus ridership were more positive andthe frequency of bus use had increased—a month after the pass had expired (111). These incentive-based interventions have significant short-term impacts, but longer-term effects are questionable,
-   Worldwide, the strongest predictors of how seriously individuals regard climate change risksare education level and beliefs about the cause of climate change. These beliefs often have less todo with awareness than with ideology. Over 75% of the population in developed countries areaware of climate change, but a much lower percentage perceive it as a serious risk
-   In 2009,the American Psychological Association (APA) Task Force on the Interface Between Psychologyand Global Climate Change reviewed decades of psychological research and practice in climatechange. They identified numerous psychological barriers that explain why people do not feel asense of urgency regarding climate change, including habit and other ingrained behaviors thatare extremely resistant to change, limited cognition about the problem, worldviews that precludeproenvironmental behaviors, undervaluing risk, discredence toward experts and authorities, anda sense of lack of control over being able to make a difference (111, 112). Moreover, the reactionto climate change risks is mediated by cultural values and beliefs (114). One of the key insights ofthe task force is that psychological barriers are key in preventing action on climate change. Thisis a significant departure from the dominant information-deficit model commonly assumed byeconomists and natural scientists. The results of the APA task force suggest that if we are to breakfree from lock-in of climate change inaction, we must address the psychological barriers.
-   Apart from habits, avoidance of risk can also lock in both repetitive and nonrepetitive envi-ronmental behaviors. Changing behaviors involves increased functional, physical, financial, social psychological, and temporal risks above the status quo (115). For example, installing solar panelson a house requires an investment in time and product research, an investment of finances, and asocial investment of publicly espousing a product that is functionally untested or that may invitesocietal judgment. Individuals are also commonly risk adverse when it comes to exploring newtravel alternatives (116, 117), creating a learning-based lock-in effect that deters transitions to newmodes of transportation.
-   Another psychological obstacle that locks in behavior is related to the nature of climate changeas a type of collective action problem. In collective action problems, individuals act as free rid-ers, feeling that they have little behavioral control and therefore little incentive to take care ofglobal environmental public goods. Behaviors are locked in by declining individual agency compared to the number of actors thatare perceived to be part of the problem.
-   Overcoming these obstacles will likely require what Thaler & Sunstein (85) call nudges: anyaspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbid-ding options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, theintervention must be easy or cheap to avoid 
-   Though choicearchitecture is unavoidable—whether exploited to benefit climate mitigation or not—nudging iscontroversial because it can be perceived as paternalistic, experimental, and dismissive of the roleof personal responsibility 
-   Lock-In of Social Structural Behaviors : 
-   Psychological studies are often criticized for understating the importance of context to behavioralmomentum. Indeed, individual behavior is constrained not only by cognitive processes but alsoby structure—embedded in existing infrastructures, technologies, cultures, norms, and routines.
-   Sociologists theorize that lock-in emerges not from practitioners that choose practices butthrough practices that recruit practitioners (121). Socially shared practices refer to routines andnorms that coevolve with the technologies, infrastructures, social networks, markets, policies, andcultural norms in place (122, 123). Practices are dynamic over time (124), responding to changesin the larger sociotechnical environment where they are embedded. 
-   Often technological innovation alters the sociotechnical landscape so that alternative practices cannot compete. For example, though cycling was the dominant form of commuting in the 1940s,its decline as a practice was the direct result of the automobile competing for investment, roadspace, and time and offering personal comfort (131). Similarly, though human thermal comfort inbuildings is quite flexible, performance requirements of electronic and computer equipment havedriven an increasingly standardized practice of heating and cooling buildings to a narrow windowof 22◦C (132)—a practice that imposes energy-intensive loads on mechanical heating, ventilation,and air conditioning systems. It is worth noting that the social landscape can be altered throughnontechnological means as well. For example, norms regarding family size have changed drasti-cally over the last century, but it is unclear that this was primarily due to technological innovation.In all examples, a change in the technological and social infrastructure causes a change in routinepractices, locking in an unsustainable demand for resources and increased emissions
-   A common criticism of social practice theory is that it is not immediately policy applicable (133).Although this is true, the literature also suggests that nudges directly change outcomes and socialpractice, and advertising can indirectly change social practice by shaping public consciousness.
-   Routines changewhen (a) the elements required to accomplish them change, (b) the populations practicing themchange, or (c) related and interdependent practices change (137). London’s bike-share programand Bogota’s bus rapid transit system are two examples of interventions that change the elements ofpractice. Instead of improving transport technologies or relying on an individual to change valuesor habits, lock-in in travel behaviors is disrupted by changing the way individuals interact with ex-isting technologies (134). Targeting social connections where routines develop is another methodfor disrupting behavioral lock-in. Interventions could facilitate connections and social networksthat strengthen desirable practices. For example, cyclists sharing information about safe commut-ing routes could lead to increasingly strong communities of alternative transportation 
-   There are numerous interconnections and interactions within and between technological, insti-tutional, and behavioral lock-in 
-   Forexample,thelock-inofgasoline-powered automobiles reflects development, introduction, and marketing by automobilecompanies that also lobbied for transportation policies and subsidies for relevant highway and en-ergy infrastructures that both created and responded to social and cultural preferences for individ-ual transportation. The dominance of automobile transportation further enabled rural, suburban,and urban development patterns that, once established, reinforced the need to maintain and expandautomobile-oriented infrastructures, creating resistance and obstacles to government efforts to in-stall mass transit systems and personal preferences against using them. 
-   Lock-inis a characteristic of the system as well as of the system’s components: Therefore, transitioninga locked-in system requires surmounting large obstacles to transition in most or all of thosecomponents. Thus, seizing opportunities before lock-in emerges or during moments of plasticityis far more likely to succeed than pushing for transitions in realms and during moments in whichcarbon lock-in is strong
-   politicians, policy makers, and policy-making institutions at the local, national, and interna-tional levels have strong incentives to maintain the status quo and to support pressures frompowerful economic interests. At the same time, they are also expected to be responsive to political,social, and cultural pressures and to provide leadership as well as representation.
-   Businesses and financial markets are motivated by profits but also desire the stability thatincreases predictable financial returns on long-lived capital investments. Thus, they often canbe convinced to support transition policies if they see how they will reduce uncertainty, stabi-lize economic markets, improve economic efficiency, or promote standardization and industrialconcentration. 
-   Individuals also have an important role to play in these transitions. Individuals play multipleroles in the processes that contribute to lock-in and foster break-out. People’s choices matter:what they consume and what energy and transportation choices they make, what jobs they chooseand how they perform those jobs, who they vote for and what policies they support, and the values they express through their behaviors and their words. If the dynamics we have discussed makelock-in difficult to avoid, the aggregate effect of these individual choices matters in whether welock in low-carbon or high-carbon technologies and trajectories. If lock-in is a feature of systemstructure, then the plasticity of the structure, its equilibrium at any point in time, and opportunitiesto alter it can be influenced by the conscious and coordinated efforts of individuals.
-   Understanding how and when lock-in emerges also helps identify windows of opportunitywhen transitions to alternative technologies and paths are possible. Such transitions prove easierto accomplish when the costs of transitioning to an alternative are low.

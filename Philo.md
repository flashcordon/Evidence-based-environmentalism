# Ethique environnementale

- Deux écoles principales : le biocentrisme et l'écocentrisme
- Pour les partisans de l'éthique biocentrique, la vie a une valeur morale intrinsèque.  Les partisans de l'éthique écocentrique, quant à eux, accorde une valeur intrinsèque à la stabilité des ecosystèmes

- Ecocentrism is the broadest term for worldviews that recognize intrinsic value in all lifeforms and  ecosystems  themselves,  including  their  abiotic  components.  Anthropocentrism,  in contrast, values other lifeforms and ecosystems insofar as they are valuable for human well-being, preferences and interests.
- Ecocentrism finds inherent (intrinsic) value  in  all  of  nature. 
- Ecocentrism goes beyond biocentrism   (ethics   that   sees   inherent   value  to  all  living  things)  by  including  environmental   systems   as   wholes,   and   their  abiotic  aspects.  It  also  goes  beyond  zoocentrism  (seeing  value  in  animals)  on  account  of  explicitly  including  flora  and the ecological contexts for organisms.
- Ecologist Aldo Leopold (1949: 203–4)  provided  a  classic  example  of  the  notion in what he called ‘The Land Ethic’: "The    land    ethic    simply    enlarges    the    boundaries  of  the  community  to  include  soils,  waters,  plants,  and  animals  [...]  A  land  ethic  of  course  cannot  prevent  the  alteration,  management,  and  use  of  these  ‘resources,’ but it does affirm their right to continued existence, and, at least in spots, their continued existence in a natural state."
- Arne Naess (1973) coined the term ‘Deep Ecology’   for   similar   sentiments,   later   articulating  the  notion  in  Principle  1  of  the  Deep  Ecology  Platform  (Devall  and  Sessions, 1985: 69): "The well-being of non-human life on Earth has value in itself. This value is independent of  any  instrumental  usefulness  for  limited  human purposes."
- The  intrinsic  value  of  nature  has  had  a  mixed   history   in   terms   of   international   recognition.  The  Stockholm  Declaration  of  1972  (see  https://is.gd/89WDc2)  noted  that  ‘natural   resources’   must   be   safeguarded   for  future  human  generations.  
- The  World  Conservation  Strategy  (International  Union  for   Conservation   of   Nature   and   Natural   Resources, 1980) also took an anthropocentric approach, with three objectives:n maintaining essential ecological processes for human survival;n   preserving   genetic   diversity   for   the   protection  of  human  industries  that  use  living resources;n    ensuring    the    sustainable    utilization    of   species   and   ecosystems   for   rural   communities and human industries.In contrast, the World Charter for Nature in 1982 was underpinned by strong ecocentric principles,  stipulating  that  humanity  and  culture  are  part  of  nature:  “Every  form  of   life   is   unique,   warranting   respect   regardless  of  its  worth  to  man,  and,  to  accord  other  organisms  such  recognition,  man  must  be  guided  by  a  moral  code  of  action” (United  Nations,  1982:  preamble). 
-   The  Rio  Declaration  (see  https://is.gd/TJjVAS)  from  the  Earth  Summit  of  1992,   similarly,   had   Principle   1   stating:   “Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development.” The Earth  Charter was finalized in 2000 (www.earthcharter.org)  and  was  proposed  for United Nations endorsement at the World Summit on Sustainable Development  (WSSD)  in  Johannesburg,  South  Africa,  in  2002.  It  strongly advanced an ecocentric worldview, urging in Principle 1a that we:Recognize that all beings are interdependent and every form of life has value regardless of its worth to human beings.
-   in 2008, Ecuador enshrined rights of nature as a part of its new Constitution (see https://is.gd/5kBr9d):Nature    or    Pachamama,    where    life    is    reproduced and exists, has the right to exist, persist,  maintain  itself  and  regenerate  its  vital  cycles,  structure,  functions  and  its  processes in evolution.
-   in  December  2010,  Bolivia  passed   its   own   constitutional   reforms,   including the Law of the Rights of Mother Earth  (see  https://is.gd/j423Hk). It defined Mother  Earth  as  “a  collective  subject  of public interest” and declared both Mother Earth  and  life-systems  (which  combine  human  communities  and  ecosystems)  as  titleholders  of  inherent  rights  specified in  the  law.  Such  positive  and  visionary  constitutional  reform  is  an  example  for  all   nations.
-   By   contrast,   however,   the   United  Nations’  Sustainable  Development  Goals  that  were  passed  in  2015  failed  to  mention ecocentrism or the intrinsic value of  nature,  or  to  acknowledge  the  rights  of  nature 
-   there  is  a  mixed  history  of  support  for  ecocentrism  (and  the  intrinsic  value  of  nature).  This  likely  reflects  the  problem  of  the  dominance of     an     anthropocentric     approach     in     government   thinking   and,   indeed,   the   anthropocentrism   prevalent   among   the   world’s  religious  traditions 
-   Stan Rowe (1994):Ecocentrism  is  not  an  argument  that  all  organisms  have  equivalent  value.  It  is  not  an  anti-human  argument  nor  a  put-down  of  those  seeking  social  justice.  It  does  not deny  that  myriad  important  homocentric  problems  exist.  But  it  stands  aside  from  these  smaller,  short-term  issues  in  order  to  consider  Ecological  Reality.  Reflecting on  the  ecological  status  of  all  organisms,  it  comprehends the Ecosphere as a Being that transcends  in  importance  any  one  single  species, even the self-named sapient one.
-   Ecocentrists    overwhelmingly    support    inter-human  justice;  however,  they  also support inter-species justice, or ecojustice, for  the  non-human  world  (B
-   anthropocentrism   continues   to   be   the   world’s dominant ideology, even in venues where  ecological  sustainability  is  a  stated  goal
-   The influential term ‘ecosystem services’ was defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA Board, 2005) as “the benefits people obtain from ecosystems.” With this anthropocentric definition, nature’s services are for humanity alone. Of course, nature provides services (habitat, nutrients and energy) to all species, and these too must be maintained
-   The United Nations and UNESCO promote ‘education for sustainable development’ (ESD; https://is.gd/j2zmuc), but both organizations consistently prioritize human rights and ignore the question of whether nature also has rights. The UNESCO 2014 ‘Roadmap’ for ESD (https://is.gd/ryk7K8), for example, failed to consider worldviews, ethics or ecocentrism.
-   Advocates of a ‘new conservation’ approach have argued that human well-being should be at the forefront of conservation efforts (Marris, 2011; Kareiva et al., 2012). It pursues economic development, poverty alleviation and corporate partnerships as substitutes for mainstream conservation tools such as protected areas (Soulé, 2013: 895). Miller et al. (2014) have compellingly argued that this anthropocentric approach is based on a “human exceptionalism” that distorts ecological science while prioritizing capitalist development over ecosystem and societal health.

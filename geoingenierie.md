- concerned scientists are now asking
whether geoengineering—the intentional,
large-scale alteration of the climate system—
might be able to limit climate change impacts.
- Geoengineering schemes can be divided
into two very different categories: carbon
dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation
management (SRM) ( 4). CDR schemes such
as direct air capture ( 8) or ocean fertilization
( 9) would remove the cause of climate change.
- technical challenges and large
uncertainties surrounding large-scale CDR
deployment, along with long delays in the climatic
response to carbon forcing, mean that it
would take decades to have notable effect ( 4).
- SRM could substantially infl uence
the climate in months, but with much
greater uncertainty about the net effects. SRM
schemes such as stratospheric aerosols and
cloud brightening aim to cool the planet by
refl ecting a fraction of the incoming sunlight
away from Earth. “Natural experiments” caused
by volcanoes have demonstrated the rapid
impact potential of SRM, and such schemes
should be technically simple to deploy at low
cost, relative to mitigation ( 3, 4). But SRM
would at best unevenly ameliorate regional climatic
change and may have serious unintended
consequences. For example, SRM could produce
droughts and delay the recovery of the
ozone layer by decades, while doing almost
nothing to address ocean acidifi cation. SRM is
thus not a substitute for mitigation
- Subscale fi eld experiments
designed to have demonstrably negligible environmental
and transboundary impacts, such as
those recently conducted in Russia ( 12), can be
valuable for testing technologies and identifying
the environmental risks of scaling up. But
the controversy surrounding a 2009 Indo-
German ocean fertilization experiment highlights
both the diffi culty of proving that the
risks of any geoengineering fi eld test are in fact
demonstrably negligible, and the political sensitivities
such tests can evoke
- confi rming the effectiveness
of an SRM scheme would require large-scale
tests with demonstrable climatic impacts—
essentially low-level deployment. But because
of the complexity and variability of the climate,
it will be extremely diffi cult to attribute
impacts and unintended consequences to any
test ( 3, 14). This means liability for damages,
real or perceived, would become a political
challenge. For example, if the Asian or African
monsoon were to weaken in a year following
an SRM test—at the edge of natural variability,
but still causing droughts and food shortages—
uncertainty about causation could fuel
accusations of responsibility.
- As a fi rst step to addressing some of these
issues, scientists should propose international
norms and best practices for research ( 10). The
upcoming Asilomar conference on Climate
Intervention Technologies in March 2010 will
bring together ~150 scientists to begin this process.
However, although necessary, such norms
are not suffi cient.
